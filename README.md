# docker-astroneer-server

## Prerequisites

The current astroneer server implementation uses an encryption algorithm that is not supported by wine's implementation of bcrypt.dll.
Due to this issue, we have to disable encryption on the server side to make things work.

To be able to connect to the server you will have to disable encryption on the client side as well.

Locate the Engine.ini file on your file system (usually located under <<USER DIR>>/AppData/Local/Astro/Saved/Config/WindowsNoEditor) and add the following line to the bottom of the file:

```
[SystemSettings]
net.AllowEncryption=False
```

For people connecting, you can just tell them to run this in Powershell/Windows Terminal:
`Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser -Force; Invoke-Expression (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liemeldert/docker-astroneer-server/develop/astroneer_encrypt.ps1").Content`

| VAR                     | Required | Default Value | Description                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ASTRO_SERVER_NAME       | Yes      |               | The name or your server.                                                                                                      |
| ASTRO_SERVER_PORT       | No       | 8777          | Custom server port                                                                                                            |
| ASTRO_SERVER_PUBLIC_IP  | No       |               | The public ip address of your server. If left empty,Â https://api.ipify.org/ will be used to determine your current ip address |
| ASTRO_SERVER_OWNER_NAME | Yes      |               | Name or the server owner (Steam username)                                                                                     |

## Starting the server

You can use the provided docker-compose.yml to start the server.

Just create a .env file in the same directory and add the necessary env vars.

If you want to import an existing save game, do it like described above.

Then run:

```
docker compose up -d
```

This may take a few minutes if the server runs the first time as it installs the server software via steamcmd and launches the server to make sure all necessary .ini files were created. 



## Using an existing save game

You can import an existing save game to the server via the following commands.

```
# Stop the server if it is already running
docker compose down

# Create the container but do not start it
docker componse create 

# Get the container id via docker ps
docker ps -a

# Copy the save game to the container's /backup/restore dir
docker cp MY_SAVE_GAME.savegame <<CONTAINER ID>>:/backup/restore/SERVER.savegame


# Start the server
docker compose up -d
```

The server will check the /tmp dir on the first run and copy the save game to the SaveGames folder.



## Backups

Backups are created every 10 minutes under `/backup` (backup volume in docker compose).

These backups are only kept for the current day and are removed by a cleanup job that  periodically runs.

The latest backup of each day gets moved to `/backup/daily` 



### Restore a backup

#### restore-backup.sh

If you use the provided docker-compose.yml you can use the restore-backup.sh script provided in this repo.

Be aware that the container must be running when using the script.

```
# Get the container id
docker ps

# List all backups and copy the name of the backup you want to restore (without /daily)
bash list-backups.sh -c <<CONTAINER_ID>>

# Run the backup script
bash restore-backup.sh -c <<CONTAINER_ID>> -b <<BACKUP_NAME>>
```

#### Manually restore

```
# Copy the backup to the local dir
docker cp <<CONTAINER_ID>>:/backup/<<BACKUP FILE PATH>> ./SERVER.savegame 

# Stop the server
docker compose stop 

# Create but don't start the container
docker-compose create 

# Get the container id
docker ps -a 

# Copy the backup file
docker cp SERVER.savegame <<CONTAINER_ID>>:/backup/restore/SERVER.savegame 

# Start the server
docker compose up -d
```
